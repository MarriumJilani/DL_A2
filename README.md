This file contains the solution to task 1 which is:
The main task of this assignment is to classify the skin cancer data into 7 different classes, one class for each type of skin cancer. You need to implement a deep neural network to obtain the results. The accuracy should reach at least 75%. Also, you need to justify how your code is different from the code implemented already on platforms like Kaggle for this problem.

# DL2_Q2
This file contains the solution to task 2 which is:
For this question, you will be using Yahoo Finance Data (Historical Stock Prices) which provides historical stock price data for various publicly traded companies. You can access this data through their website or APIs like Yahoo Finance API or pandas_datareader in Python. The data typically includes daily or hourly OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) prices, trading volumes, and date-time information. Apply any RNN model for training and testing.

# DL2_Q3
This file contains the solution to task 3 which is:
A Face expression recognition dataset is available from Kaggleâ€™s following link.

dataset/code?datasetId=99505&sortBy=dateRun&tab=profile

Build a basic convolutional neural network (CNN) model for expression recognition,
select an optimized model architecture, train hyperparameters, and achieve decent
baseline accuracy.
